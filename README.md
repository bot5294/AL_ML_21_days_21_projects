Day 1 Problem Statment
End-to-End Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset
Project Objective: To perform a comprehensive, step-by-step exploratory data analysis to understand the key factors that influenced survival on the Titanic. This notebook will serve as a complete guide, covering data loading, cleaning, analysis, feature engineering, and visualization, with theoretical explanations at each stage.

Day 2 Problem Statement
Project Objective: To perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis of the Netflix dataset. We will explore trends in content production, identify popular genres, analyze content ratings, and understand the distribution of movies and TV shows on the platform. This project builds on foundational EDA by introducing time-series analysis and more complex data cleaning and transformation techniques.
